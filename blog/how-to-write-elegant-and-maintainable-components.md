Do you still remember your first react component? If you're like me then it was probably the canonical 'hello world', or maybe something else. Regardless of how simple your first react component was, writing elegant and maintainable component can be such a pain, one that reduces in intensity with your growth as a react developer.

I just they run mouth to test this blog. Nothing serious.
