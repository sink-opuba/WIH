I am here to tell you that writing your own Gatsby plugin is way easier than you think. You maybe wondering, what the heck is this dude yarning? Yeah I know! We've all been there. Let's get started. No time to say no time. Now grab your plugin writing tools and let us get to the business of the day.

Do you still remember your first react component? If you're like me then it was probably the canonical 'hello world', or maybe something else. Regardless of how simple your first react component was, writing elegant and maintainable component can be such a pain, one that reduces in intensity with your growth as a react developer.

I just they run mouth to test this blog. Nothing serious.
